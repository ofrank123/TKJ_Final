# Terminal Jumper
By TheIntellectualOctocats (Oliver Frank, Shayan Chowdhury, and Peter Cwalina).

### Proposal
A game based on [Google Chrome’s own dinosaur easter egg game](http://www.trex-game.skipser.com), with many extensions. 
So far, we have implemented class hierarchies for each entity that is drawn on our display matrix. 
The first one is our player and the others are the various obstacles he must face in order to prove himself. 
As of now, these obstacles range from cacti to birds, compelling the player to use different strategies while playing. 
As part of our arcade game feel to it, by our extremely helpful TA Jake’s recommendation, we have added a save and high score system
that implements various topics we learnt in class including ArrayLists and sorting algorithms. We have also added a shop system, 
where the player can spend their money on various powerups and other prizes.

### Bonus/Stretch Goals
As a few bonus goals (possibly stretch goals, if time permits us) are to add enemies to our game, that randomly appear and start attacking.
For this, we may have to incorporate actual weapons in the game, but we’re still brainstorming on this idea. 
In addition, we’d also like to add to the arcade aesthetic feel to the game, with minimal graphical implementations. 
The extent to the use of graphics in our game will be ASCII art, referring to the usage of printable characters to form a larger image.
