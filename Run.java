  ================================================
  TERMINAL JUMPER
  VERSION 1.0

  by
  Oliver Frank,
  Shayan Chowdhury,
  Piotr Cwalina
  ================================================
  A game similar to google chrome's dinosaur jump
  game, where the player must time their jumps to
  make it over cacti (and hopefully other objects
  in later versions). This is only version 1 of
  this project, and there will be many more
  features to come, as well as improvement of the
  core game mechanics.
