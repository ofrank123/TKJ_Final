2018-01-08

To-Do:
Make the SaveData system more foolproof.
Fix any errors and optimize the game for running in the terminal/cmd. 
Add a shop/inventory system (already under work).
Add different difficulty levels (based on speed and frequency of enemies).
Add different types of enemies.
Work on making the code more efficient (working on modularity, etc.).
Make some minor graphical overhauls (perhaps frame animation).
Test out the game with various variables to make sure there are no loose ends.
